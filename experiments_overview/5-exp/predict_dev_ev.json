We start by selecting the label from the molecule table, as it contains the information about whether a molecule is carcinogenic or not. 2. We join the atom table with the molecule table using the molecule_id foreign key, which allows us to link an atom to its corresponding molecule. 3. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include the atom with the specified ID, TR001_10. 4. By executing this SQL statement, we will obtain the label of the molecule that the atom TR001_10 belongs to. Since the question asks for the molecule's label and whether it is carcinogenic or not, we first need to find the molecule that the atom belongs to. Then, we can check the label to determine if the molecule is carcinogenic. In this case, the label '+' signifies a carcinogenic molecule. This solution involves joining tables based on a foreign key relationship and filtering the results using a WHERE clause. The final SQL statement accurately represents the reasoning process and arrives at the desired solution.

It then computes the percentage of races completed by Japanese drivers using the formula provided in the question. Explanation of the query: 1. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT drivers.driverId) AS total_japanese_drivers, COUNT(races.raceId) AS total_races_2007_2009, SUM(CASE WHEN races.time IS NOT NULL AND drivers.nationality = 'Japanese' AND races.year BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS japanese_drivers_completion_2007_2009`: - The `SELECT` statement specifies the columns to be included in the result set. - `total_japanese_drivers` counts the distinct Japanese drivers. - `total_races_2007_2009` counts the total number of races from 2007 to 2009. - `japanese_drivers_completion_2007_2009` calculates the count of races where a Japanese driver completed (time is not null) during the specified years. 2. `FROM drivers`: - The `FROM` clause specifies the primary table, `drivers`, for the query. 3. `JOIN races ON drivers.driverId = races.driverId`: - The `JOIN` clause combines rows from the `drivers` and `races` tables based on the common `driverId` column. 4. `JOIN constructors ON races.constructorId = constructors.constructorId`: - Another `JOIN` combines rows from the `races` and `constructors` tables based on the common `constructorId` column. 5. `WHERE drivers.nationality = 'Japanese' AND races.year BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009`: - The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to include only Japanese drivers and races from 2007 to 2009. 6. `GROUP BY drivers.nationality`: - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the `nationality` column, enabling aggregation functions to be applied to each group. 7. The final calculation uses the `SUM` and `CASE` functions to count the races where a Japanese driver completed (time is not null) during the specified years and then computes the percentage of races completed by Japanese drivers. This query provides the desired race completion percentage for Japanese drivers from 2007 to 2009.\t----- bird -----\tformula_1",
