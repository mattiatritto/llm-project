The query starts by selecting all rows from the \"Patient\" table. 2. The WHERE clause filters the rows based on the given conditions for normal creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. 3. The conditions for normal CPK levels are derived from the provided normal range (CPK < 250). 4. The query then counts the number of rows that meet all the specified conditions, effectively counting the number of patients with a normal CPK level. 5. This count represents the number of patients with a positive measure of degree of coagulation, as per the question's requirement.  The final SQL statement is:  [SQL] SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Patient WHERE AST glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase < 250 AND ALT glutamic pyruvic transaminase < 250 AND lactate dehydrogenase < 250 AND alkaliphophatase < 250 AND total protein > 0 AND albumin > 0 AND uric acid < 1.5 AND urea nitrogen < 20 AND creatinine < 1.2 AND total bilirubin < 1.2 AND total cholesterol < 200 AND triglyceride < 150 AND creatinine phosphokinase < 250 AND blood glucose > 0 AND White blood cell > 4 AND Red blood cell > 4 AND Hemoglobin > 12 AND Hematoclit > 40 AND platelet > 150 AND prothrombin time > 0.8 AND activated partial prothrombin time < 1.5 AND fibrinogen > 2 AND PIC < 100 AND TAT < 10 AND TAT2 < 10 AND proteinuria = '' AND Ig G = 0 AND Ig A = 0 AND Ig M = 0 AND C-reactive protein = '' AND Rhuematoid Factor = '' AND RAHA = '' AND complement 3 > 0.5 AND complement 4 > 0.5 AND anti-ribonuclear protein = '' AND anti-SM = '' AND anti-scl70 = '' AND anti-SSA = '' AND anti-SSB = '' AND anti-centromere = '' AND anti-DNA = '' AND anti-DNA = 0; \t----- bird -----\tthrombosis_prediction",

It then filters for the specific transaction where the customer paid 124.05 in 2012/8/24. After that, it groups the results by the \"client segment\" to find the total amount spent by this customer on this date.  To find the total spent during January 2012, we need to sum up the amounts for all transactions involving this customer in that month. However, the provided transaction date is only for one day. To get the total spent in January 2012, we must consider all transactions for this customer in that month.  Unfortunately, the given schema does not include a \"year and month\" table to store transaction dates in a structured format. Therefore, it's not possible to directly calculate the total spent in January 2012 using the provided schema.  To achieve this, we would need to create a \"year and month\" table with a structured date format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD') and populate it with transaction dates. Once this table exists, we can join it with the \"transactions\" table and filter for January 2012 transactions.
